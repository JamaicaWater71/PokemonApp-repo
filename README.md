# PokemonApp
## About the Website
A simple website that uses the Pokemon API to display the first 150 Pokemon of the Pokedex.
Each Pokemon is displayed as a card and whenever the card is hovered it will display stats about that Pokemon such as 
HP and Attack.
When hovered each card has a "More Info" button that takes you to the details page that contains more information about the Pokemon.
